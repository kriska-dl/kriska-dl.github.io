            <h3 class="spec-item">Project Overview</h3>
            <p class="spec-item">Bloom is a leading regional supermarket focused on offering high-quality products and a 
                personalized shopping experience. They have an established network of premium brick & mortar 
                grocery stores conveniently located to service their client base, which exceeds 30% market share 
                in the region. Although Bloom has a long history of success with its stores, the management team 
                is aware that more and more consumers are switching to online grocery shopping due to its 
                flexibility and convenience.
  
            <h3 class="spec-item">The Challenge</h3>
            <p class="spec-item">Bloom’s vision is to design a user experience that goes above and beyond the e-commerce marketplace
                 models that Amazon and other competitors (like Walmart) are offering. They want to add value for 
                 their customers by finding a way to leverage their successful premium store model and replicate 
                 it into a differentiating digital experience.
            </p>

            <h3 class="spec-item">Our Process</h3>
            <p class="spec-item">We were only given 2 weeks to complete the research and the interface for this project. To resolve
                 this time constraint, we worked together in an Agile approach. We also used the design thinking
                  methodology to make sure that the final product meets our users' needs.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>1 - Research</h3>
            <p>We started this project by immersing ourselves in the current online grocery experience. We conducted 
                a quick "competitive analysis" to get an idea on the current market of online grocery shopping. We did 
                this by creating an inventory that assesses what we’re looking for in an online grocery store. This helped 
                us see the current trends and different approaches, as well as things that we can improve. We then moved on 
                to crafting surveys and interviews. A daunting task for beginners as it was hard to make sure that we achieve 
                quality results, but we had to learn to trust the process. In such a short time, we received enough data to 
                carry onto the next step. We used affinity mapping to organize and sort the data we received. This also helped 
                us identify trends and pain points which we later translated onto our personas.
            </p>

            <h3>2 - The Problem</h3>
            <p>Through our research and with our personas in mind, we were able to define what we wanted to focus on for our 
                MVP.  Our findings showed that people are hesitant to buy their groceries online because they don’t trust that 
                they will receive their items intact and fresh at a date and time that is convenient for them. 
                <br><br>
                <q>People don’t trust that all the items they select will be available and delivered intact & fresh at a date and time that is convenient for them.</q>
                <br><br>
                For me, this was one of the most difficult parts of the project - to put our findings in one simple statement. 
                However, once we were able to frame it, our vision became much clearer.
            </p>

            <h3>3 - The Solution</h3>
            <p>After defining our problem and getting to know our users' pain points, we moved on to ideation. We used different
                 tools and exercises to turn these pain points into design opportunities. We wanted to solve many problems but we 
                 can only pick one for our MVP.  We picked one that which we thought is the most differentiating experience if 
                 ever it comes to life. Our solution is to give customers the option to select fresh produce products based on its 
                 expiry date. So a product that has a shelf life of a week will be offered on a regular price while the other with 
                 a shorter life (ex: 3 days) will be offered on a lower discounted price.
            </p>

            <h3>4 - Wireframes</h3>
            <p>After conducting feature prioritization methods, we designed our wireframes. We also tested our product with some 
                colleagues to get feedback. Without much time, we’ve re-iterated some of the designs & flow along the way.
            </p>

            <h3>5 - Visual Design</h3>
            <p>Our original design has evolved enormously after learning from the feedback we’ve received on our initial presentation. 
                However, we kept the brand attributes moving forward.

            </div>

            <h3>6 - Future steps</h3>
            <p>In theory, we plan to continue testing our product and slowly bring in more improvements to our users’ experience. 
                We’re very curious about how our special feature will be received in real life as we definitely considered the 
                challenges on the supply chain and store operations. 
            </p>

            <h3>7 - Updates</h3>
            <p>A month after completing this project, we found a similar type of offering being tested at one of the major 
                grocery brands in The Netherlands - Albert Heijn.<br><br>
                It was a proud moment for my group. Although it is still being tested, we had a similar idea and it felt 
                like our research was validated.<br><br>
                https://worldfoodcenter.net/en/albert-heijn-gaat-dynamisch-afprijzen-tegen-voedselverspilling/
                https://www.retaildetail.eu/en/news/food/albert-heijn-trials-ai-discounts-based-expiry-dates
                <br><br>
                Maybe we’ll see Dynamic Discounts available in-store and online someday! :)
