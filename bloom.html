            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>Bloom is a leading regional supermarket focused on offering high-quality products and a 
                personalized shopping experience. They have an established network of premium brick & mortar 
                grocery stores conveniently located to service their client base, which exceeds 30% market share 
                in the region. Although Bloom has a long history of success with its stores, the management team 
                is aware that more and more consumers are switching to online grocery shopping due to its 
                flexibility and convenience.
  
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Bloom’s vision is to design a user experience that goes above and beyond the e-commerce marketplace
                 models that Amazon and other competitors (like Walmart) are offering. They want to add value for 
                 their customers by finding a way to leverage their successful premium store model and replicate 
                 it into a differentiating digital experience.
            </p>

            <h3>Our Process</h3>
            <p>We were only given 2 weeks to complete the research and the interface for this project. To resolve
                 this time constraint, we worked together in an Agile approach. We also used the design thinking
                  methodology to make sure that the final product meets our users' needs.</p>
