E-commerce brand: Improving Content Structure and User Flow
Summary
Based on feedback from our users and our support agents, I redesigned our assembly pages and updated our flow, not only to improve our users’ journey when browsing our CMS pages but to also address the internal linking of our pages.

Role:

Project Management, UX Research, Information Architecture, UI Design

Methods:

Competitors’ Analysis, Brainstorming, Sketching, Wireframing

Tools:

Miro, Figma

Teams:

Marketing, Customer Support

The Problem
We only had one page for assembly which can be accessed via the footer.

The problem with this is our users couldn't find their answers quickly, or they are frustrated when finding out that these two different names(links) on the footer goes to the same page. Many people are confused and think that they are sent to the wrong page. They end up contacting us via phone or chat for small queries in assembly.



The page shows only a short introduction of assembly and shows a link to customer support for more detailed information. This link can also be easily missed.

Analyzing our content and user flow
In order to come up with a solution that addresses the frustrations of our users and agents, I partnered with our customer support manager. We audited our content and the questions our users had.

What happens next after ordering with assembly

What do they need to prepare

Questions about ground and anchoring


The result
The final design focuses on more organized content. We created 3 new pages to address the above-mentioned issues. 


1 - Redesigned Assembly Service page

We added information about the assembly service which used to be located on the delivery page.

We included assembly reviews to promote the service.

We added a section for frequently asked questions.

We added links at the bottom of the page that are related to assembly queries.



2 - Redesigned Assembly Guide page

We added general information about assembling a climbing frame.

We included content that used to only be found in our manuals.

We added links at the bottom of the page that are related to assembly queries.

3 - Redesigned Manuals page

This page only contains links to our manuals, this allows us to easily use this page link for other marketing and transactional uses.


4 - Next steps

We are currently going through a full website redesign and we hope to further improve this page. At the moment, we are tracking our users’ behavior on these pages and hope to use the feedback and data to bring improvements to these pages when we have our new website.
